This lab requires us to make a TCP proxy server that will act as a man in the middle, creating secure connections between our client
and the server that we are trying to communicate with. We have a list of sites that we cannot connect to and we need to make sure we
don't open those connections. We are also multithreading the server to accept up to 50 connections at once, meaning we need to make sure
our program is thread safe. Lastly, we need to output access log to a file.

I struggled mightily with the Open SSL code. I couldn't figure out how to set up the certificates for creating the connection. As you'll see,
I left the proxy server as just a normal TCP HTTP proxy. Tried running different configurations I found on the internet but could never narrow
something down for it. You can see that I commented out all the code I was working on for it. I also couldn't implement the refresh on the forbidden site file with Cntl + C. Ran out of time trying to get the OpenSSL
to run properly and couldn't conceptualize how I would force quit the program if I overloaded Cntl + C.


Test cases:

bin/myproxy 9877 test1 test2

curl -x http://127.0.0.1:9877/ http://www.example.com
wget 127.0.0.1:9877 --header="Host: www.example.com"
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:9877/ http://www.example.com:555 // No address existed for this server as indicated by the false port number
wget 127.0.0.1:9877 --header="Host: pudim.com.br"
wget www.example.com -e use_proxy=yes -e http_proxy=127.0.0.1:9877

Using the read and write functions from Lab1, which were pulled from the book

https://opensource.com/article/19/6/cryptography-basics-openssl-part-1

Used this as a basis for trying to set up the OpenSSL connections

https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_read.html

Used this site as a way to figure out how to execute the SSL_read function

Used this along with strstr to parse the URI to get the information I needed to connect to the server

Website was used so that I could read in the strftime() function into the out file

Main function used to be able to extract the host and port name for the serverfd
